On September 15, 2021, representatives from two community groups shared their respective ideas for ways the city could redesign North Capitol Street in Washington, DC.

Nick Sementelli from Ward 5 for All and Conor Shaw of the Eckington Civic Association presented their proposal for a North Capitol Community Boulevard and Thaddeus Thaler, Teri Janine Quin, Bertha Holliday and Mark Galvan from the North Capitol Deckover Steering Committee shared their vision for decking over the current underpass.

Members of the community joined to learn more and ask questions of both groups.
