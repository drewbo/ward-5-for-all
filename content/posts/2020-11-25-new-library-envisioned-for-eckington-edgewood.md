A [DC Public Library report released last week](https://www.dclibrary.org/sites/default/files/DCPL_NextLibris_111020-Web.pdf)) recommended building a new facility somewhere in the Eckington/Edgewood neighborhoods -- an area they identify as a Tier 1 gap in the network.

**Adding a library here would be a major boon for our communities.** More than just books, the library's resources, programming, and physical space provide substantial opportunities for students, families, seniors, job-seekers, and more.

Even better, the library's report outlined two additional goals to maximize the impact of this project:  
  
1) To include affordable housing at the site  
2) To pick a location that emphasizes accessibility, particularly given the number of dangerous major roads in the area that act as barriers.

**These two additions would supercharge the benefits of this facility, and make this new library a triple win.**  
  
This report is just a vision to start; it's now up to the Mayor and the Council to include funding for this expansion in the budget.
