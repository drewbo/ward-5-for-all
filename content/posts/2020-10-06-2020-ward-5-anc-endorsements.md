This year Ward 5 for All reached out to every ANC candidate running in our Ward (using the publicly-available emails they provided on their BOE paperwork) to ask a series of questions related to housing, transportation, local business and safety.

We are extremely grateful to the 20 candidates who took the time to complete the questionnaire. You can download their full responses here.

Based on those responses, as well as other available information about the candidates, we are excited to endorse the following candidates in contested races:

_Note: There are still many candidates for whom there is little public information, this post reflects the endorsements we can make at this time, but will be updated as more information is available._
