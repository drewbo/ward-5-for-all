At last month’s Bloomingdale Civic Association meeting, BCA President Teri Janine Quinn revealed the results from the organization’s survey weighing community opinion about the pending historic district application for the neighborhood. With 516 votes counted, [the respondents were opposed to designation](https://bloomingdaleneighborhood.blogspot.com/2018/02/bloomingdale-civic-association-historic.html) 282 to 234\*, a 55-45 percent margin.

The survey was conducted over two weeks in January [via a postcard](http://www.bloomingdalecivicassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/BCA-historic-designation-survey-postcard-2018-01-2.jpg) mailed to each of 3,107 property owners in the neighborhood (as determined by DC tax records). It presented recipients with two response options:

- I would like to pursue historic designation of Bloomingdale
- I do not support historic designation for Bloomingdale

On the backside, the postcard informed neighbors that an application had been filed and that the results of the survey would be used to inform the BCA’s vote on it, and directed them to the [BCA](http://www.bloomingdalecivicassociation.org/historicpreservation/) and Historic Preservation Office websites for more information.

The BCA paid for the production and mailing of the survey, though recipients were required to affix their own postage to send it back.

\*An additional 48 votes were received, but postmarked after the voting deadline. BCA members voted to exclude those votes from the total (prior to hearing any survey results) by a vote of 21 to 10.
